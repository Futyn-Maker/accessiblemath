# Accessible Math

The [Accessible Math Project Page](https://mathematicsformisfits.github.io/accessiblemath/accessible_math_documentation_page.html) is a survey of software tools to generate accessible mathematics.

It began as a way to catalogue the tools I am using to create an accessible version of my book, [Mathematics for Misfits](https://linktr.ee/mathematicsformisfits){:target="_blank"}.

It became a project for a responsive web design certification through Free Code Camp.

It will be updated and maintained as new developments emerge.
