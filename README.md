# Accessible Math

This is a survey of software tools to generate accessible mathematics.

It began as a way to catalogue the tools I was using to create an accessible version of Mathematics for Misfits.

It became a project for a responsive web design certification through Free Code Camp.

It will be updated and maintained as new developments emerge.
