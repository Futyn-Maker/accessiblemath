        <p>What is Accessible Mathematics?</p>
        <p>Accessibility and Accessible Design are a wide net of principles and practices to build inclusive
          environments and make content readily available to all people.Accessible design benefits everyone, and it is
          inspired by people who use Assistive Technology (AT).
        </p>
        <p>Accessible Mathematics is the application of this to mathematics.</p>

      <header>Problem Statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>Braille, Screen Readers, Human Narration, and Tactile Sign language are four approaches to convey written
          text to visually impaired readers. Mathematics is more complicated, however, since mathematical statements
          require more grammatical rules. Furthermore, the same mathematical notation can have entirely different
          meanings based on the context. Software tools need a robust, context based semantic breakdown of mathematical
          expressions to properly translate them into non-visual formats.</p>
        <p>HyperText Markup Language (<abbr>HTML</abbr>) is the worldwide semantics-based, cross-platform, device-independent authoring standard.  Math<abbr>ML</abbr> is the extension of <abbr>HTML</abbr> to accommodate
          mathematics. However, Math<abbr>ML</abbr> syntax is generally too verbose to be coded by hand, making it
          tenuous for authoring research, textbooks, and other long-format mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>LaTeX is the worldwide standard markup language for authoring mathematics due to its concise, contextual
          syntax and huge library of extensions. But the LaTeX typesetting engine is designed for print, which strips
          away the contextual information needed for screen readers.</p>
        <p>Portable Document Format (<abbr>PDF</abbr>) is the universal open document standard for print adopted by the International Organization
          for Standardization (<abbr>ISO</abbr>). Tagged PDF is a version of PDF that incorporates a semantic structure
          similar to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, offering an ideal solution for accessible mathematics if math markup could
          be ported into the underlying semantics. This has not yet been standardized.</p>
        <p>Currently, a workflow for generating accessible mathematics content involves a hybrid approach between LaTeX
          and MathML. This process is described in stages throughout the rest of this document.</p>

      <header>Sample Workflow</header>
      <article>
        <p>Here is a high level sample workflow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write mathematics in a markup language.</li>
          <li>Include the math markup in an HTML document.</li>
          <li>Format the HTML to be structurally accessible.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a screen reader.</li>
          <li>Customize your math speech settings.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a refreshable braille display.</li>
          <li>Post the HTML document online.</li>
          <li>Test your document on various mobile devices.</li>
          <li>Share your document with users.</li>
          <li>Update the HTML to address any accessibility issues from user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is an one sample workflow with specific software:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write your mathematics in a Markdown document using LaTeX delimiters and syntax.</li>
          <li>Convert the Markdown document to <abbr>HTML</abbr> with Pandoc, using the MathJax option to convert the
            LaTeX to Math<abbr>ML</abbr>.</li>
          <li>Test your document with VoiceOver (Mac), NVDA (Windows), and TalkBack (Android) in Firefox, Chrome, and
            Safari.</li>
          <li>Customize the math Speech Rule Engine in the MathJax script settings in your <abbr>HTML</abbr> document.
          </li>
          <li>Test your document with a refreshable braille display.</li>
          <li>Upload the <abbr>HTML</abbr> file to your web site.</li>
          <li>Test your <abbr>HTML</abbr> to ensure responsiveness and readability on a mobile device.</li>
          <li>Test screen readability on a mobile device with VoiceOver (iOS) or Talkback (Android).</li>
          <li>Share your site with users.</li>
          <li>Update the <abbr>HTML</abbr> to address any accessibility issues from user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While this is considerably more work than typesetting mathematics for print, the process will produce a
          working template that can be reused and improved, just like a workflow for print.</p>

      <header>Math Markup Languages</header>
      <article>
        <p>The majority of mathematics today is written in a markup language. Three popular markup languages are: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>LaTeX</li>
          <li>MathML</li>
          <li>AsciiMath</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Plain text can be used for mathematics, with limited functionality. This is discussed at the end of this
          section.</p>
        <p>The syntax of each markup language serves a dual purpose: to reference mathematical symbols and to determine
          the placement of the symbols. LaTeX is primarily designed for print or presentation on a fixed canvas size.
          MathML and AsciiMath are primarily designed for the web to accommodate a flexible canvas. An accessible math
          workflow requires a blend of both approaches.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX</h1>
        <p>The LaTeX typesetting system is the most popular method for typesetting mathematics. LaTeX is an outgrowth of
          TeX, a markup language and layout engine created in the 1985 to standardize typesetting mathematics and
          scientific formulas for print. For those familiar with HTML, LaTeX can loosely be thought of as as
          “<abbr>HTML</abbr> for paper”. It uses a context based syntax to signify chapters, sections, figures, lists,
          equations, self-referenced labeling, graphics, code snippets, and much more. The goal is for authors to focus
          on their content and let the LaTeX typesetting engine handle the presentation. LaTeX is extensible,
          open-source, regularly updated, and has a huge library of extended tools to serve literary, scientific, and
          artistic needs.</p>
        <p>LaTeX markup can be written in any text editor, but the LaTeX typesetting engine is required to render the
          mathematical output. This is discussed in the next section on <a href="">Typesetting Software</a>.
        <h1>MathML</h1>
        <p>MathML was created in 1998 as an extension of <abbr>HTML</abbr> specifically to render mathematics on the
          web. MathML syntax is far more verbose than standard <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and is generally not coded by hand.
          Instead, <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors or conversion tools from the other languages to MathML are used to produce
          MathML code. There are two versions of MathML: <strong>Presentation MathML</strong> and <strong>Content
            MathML</strong>.</p>
        <h1>AsciiMath</h1>
        <p>AsciiMath is a math markup language for a small set of the most commonly used mathematical symbols. The
          syntax for a symbol is meant to mimic the symbol it represents, similar in spirit to emotive
          <abbr>ASCII</abbr> expressions that predate modern emoticons. It shares some similarity with basic LaTeX
          markup. </p>
        <h1>Plain Text</h1>
        <p>The Unicode Character Set contains a large collection of mathematical symbols that can be typed in plain
          text, without any special markup. This is only practical for very basic mathematical expressions, as it does
          not provide any additional formatting structure for fractions, matrices, and other special mathematical needs.
          Further, while the Unicode Character Set is updated periodically, it cannot immediately be amended to work
          with custom symbols. Still, it is worth mentioning because Unicode symbols will provide uniform semantic
          information to assistive technology across all platforms. This is the gold standard for accessibility.</p>

      <header>Typesetting Software</header>
      <article>
        <p>Any math markup can be written in any plain text editor, but a typesetting engine is needed to interpret the
          markup and render the resulting mathematics. Thus, most authors use an integrated development environment
          (<abbr>IDE</abbr>), a software suite that provides all the necessary functionality in one package. A few
          popular software tools are listed here, but there are many more available with their own unique features.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX</h1>
        <p>The LaTeX typesetting system includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The core typesetting engine</li>
          <li>A collection of add-on libraries</li>
          <li>A self-updating utility</li>
          <li>An editor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Versions vary by operating system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MacTeX -- MacOS</li>
          <li>MikTeX -- Windows</li>
          <li>Linux -- varies by distribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Popular <abbr>IDE</abbr>s are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Overleaf -- online (Note: no installation required)</li>
          <li>TexShop -- Mac</li>
          <li>TeXworks -- Windows</li>
          <li>TeXstudio -- Linux</li>
          <li>LyX -- all platforms</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <a href="https://editor.codecogs.com/" target="_blank">Code-Cogs Online LaTeX Editor</a> is a helpful
          browser based reference tool for popular LaTeX symbols.</p>
        <p>More information is available at <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">The LaTeX
            Project</a> website. </p>
        <h1>MathML</h1>
        <p>MathML syntax is far more verbose than LaTeX and <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Consequently, most authors use a
          <abbr>GUI</abbr> editor instead of coding MathML directly. Please see the <a href="">Code Examples</a> section
          for a comparison of MathML and LaTeX code. </p>
        <p>Popular MathML <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wiris MathType -- standalone or as a part of various Office Suites and Learning Management Systems (all
            platforms)</li>
          <li>Wiris MathFlow -- as a part of various professional XML systems</li>
          <li>Mathcha -- online or downloadable Notebook editor (Mac/Windows/Linux)</li>
          <li>MathML Central -- online converter by Wolfram Research</li>
        </ol>
        <p><abbr>GUI</abbr> editors offer interactive menus and an instant preview of the output
          without the need to learn the underlying markup language. This may be more efficient for authoring documents
          with a small amount of mathematical content.</p>
        <p>Some drawbacks of MathML:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><abbr>GUI</abbr> editors are not always accessible friendly.</li>
          <li><abbr>GUI</abbr> are not efficient for long-form mathematics.
          <li>MathML is still not natively supported in some modern browsers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To remedy this last point, there are Javascript tools that will render MathML in any modern
          browser. This is discussed in the <a href="">Web Display Engines</a> section.</p>
        <h1>AsciiMath</h1>
        <p>AsciiMath can be written with a text editor or any <abbr>HTML</abbr> authoring software. It is rendered in a
          web browsers with the MathJax display engine. Instructions are provided on the <a href="">AsciiMath home
            page</a>.</p>
        <h1>GNU TeXmacs</h1>
        <p>GNU TeXmacs is a <abbr>WYSIWYG</abbr> typesetting system that uses its own internal markup for rendering
          mathematics and scientific expressions. It was created as an alternative to LaTeX, incorporating realtime
          rendering and a more standardized internal data structure that can export to several different output formats.
          It is free and extensible, and can also operate as a front end for a number of other powerful mathematical
          software packages. More information is available at the <a href="" target="_blank">TeXmacs web site</a>.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is no mention of accessibility, screen reader output, or other
          <abbr>ARIA</abbr>-specific features in the TeXmacs documentation. Further testing is needed to determine how
          its conversions to <abbr>HTML</abbr> and MathML react with screen readers.

      <article>
        <p>LaTeX is widely adopted and efficient to code, but does not yet provide a navigable document structure to
          assistive technology. MathML provides this structure, but it is inefficient to code and not supported in some
          browsers. To bridge this gap, there are JavaScript tools that convert LaTeX markup to MathML and
          display the MathML in a browser:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>MathJax</li>
          <li>KaTeX</li>
          <li>MathLive</li>
          <li>MathQuill</li>
          <li>Latex.css</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These tools aim to provide a "best of both worlds" approach, where assistive technology can navigate MathML
          just as easily as <abbr>HTML</abbr>, while the underlying LaTeX markup can be translated to screen reader and
          Braille output. Each varies in its scope, method of application, and accessibility support.</p>
        <h1>MathJax</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank">MathJax</a> is the most popular method to render
          mathematics on the web. The MathJax engine searches an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document for mathematics markup
          embedded between LaTeX-style math mode delimiters (which are customizable), and renders it as math content on
          a web page. Users can customize the display formats (MathML fonts or <abbr>SVG</abbr> graphic), extract the
          math markup in both the LaTeX and MathML formats, and customize its math Speech Rule Engine
          (<abbr>SRE</abbr>). It integrates well with major content and learning management systems, and its excellent
          accessibility support makes it a key component of porting long-form mathematics into accessible friendly
          formats.</p>
        <h1>KaTeX</h1>
        <p><a href="https://katex.org/" target="_blank">KaTeX</a> is an engine that purports to render much faster than
          MathJax. This can provide a significant load time speedup for longer documents with a dense amount of LaTeX
          markup. Unfortunately, at this time, KaTeX has zero accessibility support, as assistive technology cannot read
          the MathML rendered by KaTeX. Therefore, it is <strong>not advisable</strong> to use KaTeX to port mathematics
          for non-sighted users.</p>
        <h1>MathLive</h1>
        <p><a href="https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/" target="_blank">MathLive</a> is a component of the <a
            href="https://cortexjs.io/" target="_blank">Cortex.js</a> family of web-based mathematical applications.
          MathLive accepts LaTeX input, offers a virtual keyboard with popular mathematical symbols, and offers a choice
          between its own built-in speech rules for screen reader math output or the same Speech Rule Engine
          (<abbr>SRE</abbr>) used in MathJax, both of which are customizable.</p>
        <h1>MathQuill</h1>
        <p><a href="http://mathquill.com/" target="_blank">MathQuill</a> offers an interactive web formula editor where
          users can enter text or LaTeX-style math markup and see it rendered into MathML in real-time. Users can also
          render static formulas in a web page through its coding interface. MathQuill does not appear to offer
          support for screen readers nor other assistive technology at this time.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX.css</h1>
        <p><a href="https://latex.vercel.app/" target="_blank">LaTeX.css</a> is a very cleverly constructed
          <abbr>CSS</abbr> library that faithfully reproduces LaTeX-style formatting for numerous LaTeX environments,
          providing a more seamless transition for those coming from a LaTeX background. LaTeX.css is not its own
          JavaScript math display engine; rather, it uses MathJax to render mathematics formula, giving it a full
          set of accessibility features.
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="topic_2c">
      <header>Conversion Tools</header>
      <article>
        <p>Web display engines only read and render mathematics markup already contained in an <abbr>HTML</abbr>
          document.
          The HTML document must be configured to use a display engine through its <span
            class="inline-code">&lt;script&gt;</span>
          parameters, and most likely will require some <abbr>CSS</abbr> styling to accommodate different devices
          accessing the content.
          This contrasts with the LaTeX philosophy where an author should not have to worry about presentation and
          styling.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, one may need to convert entire documents containing a host of other content.
          An article written in LaTeX, for example, may contain:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inline mathematics</li>
          <li>Block display mathematics</li>
          <li>Abstract</li>
          <li>Table of Contents</li>
          <li>Document Sections</li>
          <li>Tables</li>
          <li>Special formatting for content blocks such as theorems, lemmas, and definitions.</li>
          <li>Numbered or bulleted lists</li>
          <li>Images</li>
          <li>Figures</li>
          <li>Code Blocks</li>
          <li>Footnotes</li>
          <li>Automatic numbering for any of the above</li>
          <li>Bibliography</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As many of these elements are also native to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, a direct conversion is theoretically
          <em>possible</em>, but quite difficult in practice.
        </p>
        <p>There are several document conversion tools to assist with this part of the process. Each has their own
          strengths, and each conversion will require some additional testing for responsiveness across devices and
          accessibility support. The tools discussed here are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Markdown</li>
          <li>Pandoc</li>
          <li>TeX4ht</li>
          <li>Latexml</li>
          <li>Latex.js</li>
          <li>Latex2html</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Markdown</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> is not so much a
          conversion <em>tool</em> as it is a markup language itself that is meant to <em>be converted</em> into
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Markdown is a bridge between plain text and <abbr>HTML</abbr>, designed for fast authoring
          but still readable as plain text. Markdown uses syntax such as <span class="inline-code">*emphasis
            text*</span> to represent <em>emphasis text</em> and <span class="inline-code">**strong**</span> to
          represent <strong>strong text</strong>. It is an ideal option for authors that want to minimize the amount of
          additional coding needed to render their work.
        </p>
        <p>Markdown can be written in any text editor, but requires a Markdown reader to render its output. Many
          browsers, collaborative workspaces, and online forums can automatically
          read and render Markdown. Markdown has also been expanded and customized within different
          document editing software. See, for example, the entry on <a href="">R Markdown</a> below.</p>
        <p>LaTeX markup can be included in a Markdown document by enclosing the LaTeX code between math mode delimiters,
          just as in an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document. Then, the entire Markdown document can be converted to
          <abbr>HTML</abbr> by a popular tool called Pandoc. This process is described below.
        </p>

        <h1>Pandoc</h1>
        <p><a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> is an extremely powerful "universal
          document converter" capable of parsing and converting between hundreds of file formats. It is run from a
          command line interface (<abbr>CLI</abbr>) by specifying the to- and from- formats along with any special
          options available to those formats.</p>
        <p>Pandoc can call MathJax (or another engine) to render mathematics when it converts a document
          to <abbr>HTML</abbr>. The resulting <abbr>HTML</abbr> file will have MathJax automatically set up in the <span
            class="inline-code">script</span> section, and can work as a template for future use.</p>
        <p><em>Please note:</em> Pandoc can also convert directly from a LaTeX source file, but content
          such as figures, tables, section headers, and other structured LaTeX syntax might not translate
          as well into HTML. The recommended approach is to write the document in Markdown and
          enclose mathematics between math mode delimiters. Pandoc uses its own expanded version of Markdown
          (called <a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown" target="_blank">Pandoc Markdown</a>)
          with its own syntax for this extra structure.</p>

        <h1>TeX4ht</h1>
        <p><a href="https://tug.org/tex4ht/" target="_blank">TeX4ht</a> was developed in 2004 to convert directly from
          TeX source files to <abbr>HTML</abbr> and several other formats. It is now included as part of the TeXLive and
          MikTeX distributions. It incorporates MathJax (and other methods) for mathematics output, includes the ability
          to add some custom <abbr>CSS</abbr> to the final <abbr>HTML</abbr> output, can convert documents written with
          R Markdown (discussed under the Ebooks section) and Overleaf, and has other unique features.</p>
        <h1>LaTeXML</h1>
        <p><a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a> was developed to convert LaTeX markup to an
          internal <abbr>XML</abbr> format specifically for the <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/" target="_blank">Digital
            Library of Mathematical Functions</a> (<abbr>DLMF</abbr>) project at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/"
            target="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (<abbr>NIST</abbr>). In turn, the
          internal <abbr>XML</abbr> could be used to export to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, with various customizable settings. It
          also uses MathJax to render mathematics. The LaTeXML site has a sample web editor that converts user input to
          rendered <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and offers numerous built-in examples.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX.js</h1>
        <p><a href="https://latex.js.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX.js</a> is an interesting engine that ports full LaTeX
          documents into <abbr>HTML</abbr> while also reproducing their original LaTeX style formatting, similar to
          LaTeX.css. The web site showcases a side by side comparison of a sample LaTeX document to the rendered
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>. The engine is extensible and the project aims to automate translation of more native LaTeX
          environments. LaTeX.js uses the KaTeX engine to render mathematical formulas, and thus does not have
          accessibility support at this time.
        </p>
        <h1>LaTeX2HTML</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.latex2html.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX2HTML</a> was way ahead of the curve, dating back
          to 1999. It is a command line tool that converts a LaTeX document into several <abbr>HTML</abbr> files to
          provide
          a paginated navigation similar to the original LaTeX PDF output. It automatically generates necessary
          hyperlinks, recreates lists, and converts mathematics, tables, and figures as into images. While the process
          does not provide alt-text, an author can insert alt-text for all necessary components.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Tagged PDF is a semantically enriched PDF that provides meta document information
          and navigation structure for assistive technology. The
          <a href="https://accessible-docs.com/overview-pdf-ua-standard/" target="_blank">PDF
            for Universal Accessibility</a> (<abbr>PDF/UA</abbr>) standard,
          established in 2012, specifies the requirements for a PDF to be fully accessible compliant.
        </p>
        <p>Tagged PDF documents can be created from source documents with <a href="https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/documents/pdf-word/" target="_blank">Microsoft Word</a>, <a href="https://collegeofthedesert.instructure.com/courses/11049/files/198018/" target="_blank">OpenOffice Writer</a>, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/structuring-pdfs.html" target="_blank">Adobe InDesign</a>, and other Adobe products.  Adobe Acrobat Pro can create and edit tags in any PDF document, and various other PDF editing software (<a href="https://www.foxit.com/solution/accessibility/" target="_blank">Foxit</a>, <a href="https://equidox.co" target="_blank">Equidox</a>, <a href="https://commonlook.com/about/" target="_blank">CommonLook</a>) provide tagging and PDF accessibility services.</p>
        <p><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/creating-accessible-pdfs.html">Adobe Acrobat documentation</a> provides an overview of creating accessible PDFs.  A shorter introduction is available at <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/" target="_blank">WebAIM</a>.</p>
        <p>Since much of mathematics is written and formatted for print by PDF, Tagged PDF is an ideal medium for accessible mathematics.  However, Tagged PDF cannot yet parse math markup for screen readers.  There is a <span class="inline-code">&lt;formula&gt;</span> tag to denote mathematical expressions, and Adobe <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondcamden/status/1511453103178006532?s=20&t=Pw_Xehqv5XFpA0pMrlwaBw" target="_blank">advises using an SVG image</a> of the mathematical expression with alt-text for accessibility at this time.</p>
          
        <p>There are independent efforts underway to provide Tagged PDF with a robust semantic structure for mathematics:</p>

        <h1>Nemeth Braille</h1>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/mathscience/nemeth1972.pdf" target="_blank">Nemeth Braille
            Code</a>
          was created in 1946 by Dr. Abraham Nemeth to represent
          mathematical expressions and scientific content that was not possible with the
          English Braille American Edition (<abbr>EBAE</abbr>) literary Braille system alone.
          Nemeth Braille uses a 6-dot Braille cell, the same as literary Braille, with a mix
          of its own unique symbols and standard EBAE. Nemeth expressions are
          embedded in literary Braille between special opening and closing symbols
          (called <em>Nemeth Indicators</em>) that inform the reader when a mathematical or
          scientific expression begins and ends.</p>
        <p>Nemeth Braille was officially adopted by the Braille Authority of North America
          (<abbr>BANA</abbr>) in 1952, last revised in 1972, and has been consistenly updated to
          represent modern mathematics, chemical equations, and other scientific disciplines.</p>
        <p>More recently, <a href="http://www.dotlessbraille.org/nubs.htm" target="_blank">the Nemeth Uniform Braille
            System</a> (<abbr>NUBS</abbr>) was proposed to better unify Nemeth Braille with literary Braille.</p>
        <p>Nemeth transcription for readers: </p>
        <h1><abbr>UEB</abbr></h1>
        <p><a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/ueb.html" target="_blank">Unified English Braille</a>
          (<abbr>UEB</abbr>)
          is an overhaul of English Braille American Edition literary system to modernize and unify literary,
          mathematical, and scientific content under one standard, and improve translation
          between printed text and Braille. UEB was officially adopted by the Braille Authority of
          North America in 2012. UEB uses a different convention for mathematics than Nemeth Braille.
          Due to the ubiquity of Nemeth Braille, UEB was updated in 2015 to allow readers to
          use their preferred style for mathematics.</p>
        <p>UEB transcription for readers:</p>
        <h1>GS8</h1>
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120219024932/http://dots.physics.orst.edu/gs.html"
            target="_blank">GS8</a> Braille is named after its two creators, physicist
          <a href="https://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/06/43/4/gardner.html" target="_blank">John Gardner</a>
          and mathematician Norberto Salinas. It was developed to directly mirror LaTeX markup with Braille
          symbols. It uses an 8-dot Braille cell to accommodate a large set of base symbols from which the
          many thousands of mathematical and scientific symbols available in LaTeX can be constructed.
          GS8 is not in wide use, but may be preferable to those authoring in LaTeX.
          dCode offers an online <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/gs8-braille-code" target="_blank">GS8
            encoder/decoder</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Dr. Gardner pioneered a method to display data and graphs using Braille.</p>

        <h1>DotsPlus</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.washington.edu/doit/what-dotsplus-braille" target="_blank">DotsPlus</a> is a
          two-dimensional Braille system designed more as a tactile font that mimics a written symbol. It was
          designed as a means for educators
          to present mathematics or other scientific content to blind users without having to learn Braille.
          Can DotsPlus be written in MathML and Latex?
          Then output with the DotsPlus font.</p>

        <p>The typesetting platforms in this section are geared towards creating accessible-friendly
          mathematics and science e-books. There is a bit more of a learning curve than the
          typesetting software mentioned earlier in this document, but the payoff is a significantly

        <h1>R Markdown</h1>
        <p>R Markdown is an extended version of Markdown that works with in tandem with
          the <a href="" target="_blank">R scripting language.</a> The engine allows users to include
          and execute code from R and several other languages, and export to HTML, PDF, presentation slides,
          and (many) other formats from the same source. It uses MathJax to render mathematics,
          and incorporates LaTeX functionality such as equation auto-numbering, labels and referencing,
          and theorems and other special environments. Bookdown is a specific R package to compile and
          generate R Markdown documents into EPUB, MOBI, PDF, and an HTML navigable book format.
          The <a href="" target="_blank">Bookdown website</a> has many free books created with bookdown,
          including guides on R Markdown, the bookdown package, and using the R language.</p>

        <p>Not only does R Markdown produce a high quality accessible document, it is also a versatile
          <a href="https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/rmarkdown/" target="_blank"> accessible friendly
            authoring tool</a>. The
          <a href="https://github.com/ajrgodfrey/Braille" target="_blank">BrailleR package</a>
          provides a Braille option specific to coding in R for blind users.
        </p>

        <h1>PreTeXt</h1>
        <p><a href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank">PreTeXt</a>, originally known as MathBook XML,
          is an outgrowth of the <a href="https://utmost.aimath.org" target="_blank">Undergraduate Teaching
            in Mathematics with Open Software and Textbooks</a> (<abbr>UTMOST</abbr>) project through the
          <a href="http://aimath.org/" target="_blank">American Institute for Mathematics</a>
          (<abbr>AIM</abbr>). PreTeXt is its own XML that can be exported to HTML, PDF, Jupyter Notebooks,
          Nemeth Braille (using MathJax), and other formats. For mathematics, PreTeXt uses a hybrid of
          MathML to indicate math mode, LaTeX syntax for mathematics markup, and MathJax for renderzing.
          It can be written in any editor, and it is compiled from a command line interface. An authoring
          guide, sample files, and several free textbooks written with PreTeXt are all available on
          the PreTeXt website.
        </p>
        <h1>Calibre</h1>
        <p><a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank">Calibre</a> is a popular open source,
          cross-platform e-book reader, management tool, and e-book authoring software. It uses
          MathJax to read LaTeX input and renders mathematics as SVG images. The online user manual
          has a <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/typesetting_math.html" target="_blank">sample HTML
            document</a> that can be used as a template for mathematics, as well as a sample EPUB
          file of the same content. It may be an easier entry point for LaTeX authors who are already
          familiar with HTML to get an ebook up and running without too much extra work.
        </p>
        <h1>DAISY</h1>
        <p>DAISY (Digital Audiobased Information SYstem) is an international consortium that develops
          tools to create and publish accessible reading materials. DAISY helped create
          the EPUB standard, pioneered Digital Talking Books (DAISY 3), offers accessible book
          production software, and operates as a news, events, and networking source. Please see
          <a href="https://daisy.org/activities/" target="_blank">DAISY Activities</a> page for a
          detailed list.
        </p>
        <p>The DAISY XML standard integrates MathML to display math, and provides the option to
          synchronize a recorded narration of the mathematical content with it.
          This has an advantage over screen readers as an author can best customize the audio
          description to meet readers' needs. Authoring information is available
