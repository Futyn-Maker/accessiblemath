        <p>What is Accessible Mathematics?</p>
        <p>Accessibility and Accessible Design are a wide net of principles and practices to build inclusive
          environments and make content readily available to all people. Accessible design benefits everyone, and it is
          inspired by people who use Assistive Technology (AT).
        </p>
        <p>Accessible Mathematics is the application of this to mathematics.</p>

      <header>Problem Statement</header>
      <article>
        <p>Braille, Screen Readers, Human Narration, and Tactile Sign language are four approaches to conveying textual
          information to visually impaired readers. This is a more difficult task with mathematics because mathematical
          expressions require many more grammatical rules, and the same mathematical syntax may have several different
          semantic meanings based on the context. Software tools need a robust, context based semantic breakdown of
          mathematical expressions to parse these ambiguities.</p>
        <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> has become the worldwide, cross-platform, device-independent markup language for encoding
          semantic information behind presented content. Math<abbr>ML</abbr> is the extension of <abbr>HTML</abbr>
          created to accommodate mathematics. Unfortunately, Math<abbr>ML</abbr> syntax is very verbose and generally
          not coded by hand, making it tenuous for authoring research, textbooks, and other long-format mathematics.</p>
        <p>LaTeX is the worldwide standard markup language for authoring mathematics due to its concise, contextual
          syntax and huge library specialized extensions. But the LaTeX typesetting engine is designed for print, which
          strips away the contextual information needed for screen readers (tagged pdf articles).</p>
        <p>A workflow for generating accessible mathematics content involves a hybrid approach between LaTeX and MathML.
          This process is described in stages throughout the rest of this document.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="topic_1b">
      <header>Sample Workflow</header>
      <article>
        <p>Here is a high level sample workflow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write mathematics in a markup language.</li>
          <li>Include the math markup in an html document.</li>
          <li>Format the html to be structurally accessible.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a screen reader.</li>
          <li>Customize the math Speech Rule Engine.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a refreshable braille display.</li>
          <li>Host the html file on a site.</li>
          <li>Share your site with users.</li>
          <li>Update the html to address any accessibility issues from user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is an one sample workflow with specific software:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write your mathematics in a Markdown document using LaTeX delimiters and syntax.</li>
          <li>Convert the Markdown document to <abbr>HTML</abbr> with Pandoc, using the MathJax option to convert the
            LaTeX to Math<abbr>ML</abbr>.</li>
          <li>Test your document with VoiceOver (Mac), NVDA (Windows), and TalkBack (Android) in Firefox, Chrome, and
            Safari.</li>
          <li>Customize the settings for the math Speech Rule Engine within the MathJax script of your <abbr>HTML</abbr>
            file.</li>
          <li>Test your document with a refreshable braille display.</li>
          <li>Upload the <abbr>HTML</abbr> file to your web site.</li>
          <li>Test your <abbr>HTML</abbr> to ensure responsiveness and readability on a mobile device.</li>
          <li>Test screen readability on a mobile device with VoiceOver (iOS) or Talkback (Android).</li>
          <li>Share your site with users.</li>
          <li>Update the <abbr>HTML</abbr> to address any accessibility issues from user feedback.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While this is considerably more work than typesetting mathematics for print, the process will produce a
          working template that can be reused and improved, just like a workflow for print.</p>

      <header>Math Markup Languages</header>
      <article>
        <p>Typeset mathematics is primarily written in a markup language. Three popular markup languages are: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>LaTeX</li>
          <li>MathML</li>
          <li>AsciiMath</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Plain text can be used for mathematics, with limited functionality. This is discussed at the end of this
          section.</p>
        <p>The syntax of each markup language serves a dual purpose: to reference mathematical symbols and to determine
          the placement of the symbols based on the context. LaTeX is primarily designed for print or slide
          presentations on a fixed canvas size. MathML and AsciiMath are primarily designed for the web to accommodate a
          flexible canvas. Currently, a robust accessible math workflow requires a blend of both approaches.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX</h1>
        <p>The LaTeX typesetting system is the most popular method for typesetting mathematics. LaTeX is an outgrowth of
          TeX, a markup language and typesetting engine created in the 1985 to standardize typesetting mathematics and
          scientific formulas with printed text. For those familiar with HTML, LaTeX can loosely be thought of as as
          “<abbr>HTML</abbr> for paper”. It uses a context based syntax to signify chapters, sections, figures, lists,
          equations, self-referenced labeling, graphics, code snippets, and much, much more. This allows authors to
          focus on the content and let the LaTeX typesetting engine handle the presentation. LaTeX is extensible,
          open-source, regularly updated, and has a huge library of extended tools to serve literary, scientific, and
          artistic needs.</p>
        <p>LaTeX markup can be written in any text editor, but the LaTeX typesetting engine is required to render the
          mathematical output. This is discussed in the next section on <a href="">Typesetting Software</a>.
        <h1>MathML</h1>
        <p>MathML was created in 1998 as an extension of <abbr>HTML</abbr> specifically to render mathematics on the
          web. MathML syntax is far more verbose than standard <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and is generally not coded by hand.
          Instead, <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors or conversion tools from the other languages to MathML are used to produce
          MathML code. There are two versions of MathML: <strong>Presentation MathML</strong> and <strong>Content
            MathML</strong>.</p>
        <h1>AsciiMath</h1>
        <p>AsciiMath is a math markup language for a small set of the most commonly used mathematical symbols. The
          syntax for a symbol is meant to mimic the symbol it represents, similar in spirit to emotive
          <abbr>ASCII</abbr> expressions that predate modern emoticons. It shares some similarity with basic LaTeX
          markup.</p>
        <h1>Plain Text</h1>
        <p>The Unicode Character Set contains a large collection of mathematical symbols that can be typed in plain
          text, without any special markup. This is only practical for very basic mathematical expressions, as it does
          not provide any additional formatting structure for fractions, matrices, and other special mathematical needs.
          Further, while the Unicode Character Set is updated periodically, it cannot immediately be amended to work
          with custom symbols. Still, it is worth mentioning because Unicode symbols will provide uniform semantic
          information to assistive technology across all platforms. This is the gold standard for accessibility.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="topic_2a">
      <header>Typesetting Software</header>
      <article>
        <p>Any math markup syntax can be written in any plain text editor, but a typesetting engine is needed to
          interpret the markup and render the resulting mathematics. Thus, most authors use an <strong>integrated
            development environment</strong> (<abbr>IDE</abbr>), a software suite that provides all the necessary
          functionality in one package. We list a few popular software tools here, but please note there are many more
          available with their own unique features.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX</h1>
        <p>The LaTeX typesetting system includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The core typesetting engine</li>
          <li>A collection of add-on libraries</li>
          <li>A self-updating utility</li>
          <li>An editor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Versions vary by operating system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MacTeX -- MacOS</li>
          <li>MikTeX -- Windows</li>
          <li>Linux -- varies by distribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Popular <abbr>IDE</abbr>s are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Overleaf -- online (Note: no installation required)</li>
          <li>TexShop -- Mac</li>
          <li>TeXworks -- Windows</li>
          <li>TeXstudio -- Linux</li>
          <li>LyX -- all platforms</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <a href="https://editor.codecogs.com/" target="_blank">Code-Cogs Online LaTeX Editor</a> is a helpful
          browser based reference tool for popular LaTeX symbols.</p>
        <p>More information is available at <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">The LaTeX
            Project</a> website.
        </p>
        <h1>MathML</h1>
        <p>MathML syntax is far more verbose than LaTeX and <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Consequently, most authors use a
          <abbr>GUI</abbr> editor instead of coding MathML directly. Please see the <a href="">Code Examples</a> section
          for a comparison of MathML and LaTeX code.</p>
        <p>Popular MathML <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wiris MathType -- standalone or as a part of various Office Suites and Learning Management Systems (all
            platforms)</li>
          <li>Wiris MathFlow -- as a part of various professional XML systems</li>
          <li>Mathcha -- online or downloadable Notebook editor (Mac/Windows/Linux)</li>
          <li>MathML Central -- online converter by Wolfram Research</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The above <abbr>GUI</abbr> editors offer interactive menus and an instant preview of the rendered output,
          without the need to learn the underlying markup language. This may be more efficient for authoring documents
          with a small amount of mathematical content. </p>
        <p>Some drawbacks of MathML:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><abbr>GUI</abbr> editors are not always accessible friendly.</li>
          <li><abbr>GUI</abbr> are not efficient for long-form mathematics.
          <li>MathML is still not natively supported in some modern browsers, despite being an extension of
            <abbr>HTML</abbr>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To remedy this last point, there are a number of Javascript tools that can render MathML in any modern
          browser. This is discussed in the <a href="">Web Display Engines</a> section.</p>
        <h1>AsciiMath</h1>
        <p>AsciiMath can be written with a text editor or any <abbr>HTML</abbr> authoring software. It is rendered in a
          web browsers with the MathJax display engine. Instructions are provided on the <a href="">AsciiMath home
            page</a>.</p>
        <h1>GNU TeXmacs</h1>
        <p>GNU TeXmacs is a <abbr>WYSIWYG</abbr> typesetting system that uses its own internal markup for rendering
          mathematics and scientific expressions. It was created as an alternative to LaTeX, incorporating realtime
          rendering and a more standardized internal data structure that can export to several different output formats.
          It is free and extensible, and can also operate as a front end for a number of other powerful mathematical
          software packages. More information is available at the <a href="" target="_blank">TeXmacs web site</a>.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is no mention of accessibility, screen reader output, or other
          <abbr>ARIA</abbr>-specific features in the TeXmacs documentation. Further testing is needed to determine how
          its conversions to <abbr>HTML</abbr> and MathML react with screen readers.

      <header>Web Display Engines</header>
      <article>
        <p>LaTeX is widely adopted and efficient to code, but does not provide a navigable document structure to
          assistive technology. MathML provides this structure, but it is inefficient to code and not supported in some
          browsers. To bridge this gap, there are JavaScript display engines that convert LaTeX markup to MathML and
          display the MathML in a browser:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>MathJax</li>
          <li>KaTeX</li>
          <li>MathLive</li>
          <li>MathQuill</li>
          <li>Latex.css</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These tools aim to provide a "best of both worlds" approach, where assistive technology can navigate MathML
          just as easily as <abbr>HTML</abbr>, while the underlying LaTeX markup can be translated to screen reader and
          Braille output. Each varies in its scope, method of application, and accessibility support.</p>
        <h1>MathJax</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="_blank">MathJax</a> is the most popular method to render
          mathematics on the web. The MathJax engine searches an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document for mathematics markup
          embedded between LaTeX-style math mode delimiters (which are customizable), and renders it as math content on
          a web page. Users can customize the display formats (MathML fonts or <abbr>SVG</abbr> graphic), extract the
          math markup in both the LaTeX and MathML formats, and customize its math Speech Rule Engine
          (<abbr>SRE</abbr>). It integrates well with major content and learning management systems, and its excellent
          accessibility support makes it a key component of porting long-form mathematics into accessible friendly
          formats.</p>
        <h1>KaTeX</h1>
        <p><a href="https://katex.org/" target="_blank">KaTeX</a> is an engine that purports to render much faster than
          MathJax. This can provide a significant load time speedup for longer documents with a dense amount of LaTeX
          markup. Unfortunately, at this time, KaTeX has zero accessibility support, as assistive technology cannot read
          the MathML rendered by KaTeX. Therefore, it is <strong>not advisable</strong> to use KaTeX to port mathematics
          for non-sighted users.</p>
        <h1>MathLive</h1>
        <p><a href="https://cortexjs.io/mathlive/" target="_blank">MathLive</a> is a component of the <a
            href="https://cortexjs.io/" target="_blank">Cortex.js</a> family of web-based mathematical applications.
          MathLive accepts LaTeX input, offers a virtual keyboard with popular mathematical symbols, and offers a choice
          between its own built-in speech rules for screen reader math output or the same Speech Rule Engine
          (<abbr>SRE</abbr>) used in MathJax, both of which are customizable.</p>
        <h1>MathQuill</h1>
        <p><a href="http://mathquill.com/" target="_blank">MathQuill</a> offers an interactive web formula editor where
          users can enter text or LaTeX-style math markup and see it rendered into MathML in real-time. It can also
          render individual, static formulas through individual function calls. MathQuill does not appear to offer
          support for screen readers nor other assistive technology at this time.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX.css</h1>
        <p><a href="https://latex.vercel.app/" target="_blank">LaTeX.css</a> is a very cleverly constructed
          <abbr>CSS</abbr> library that faithfully reproduces LaTeX-style formatting for numerous LaTeX environments,
          providing a more seamless transition for those coming from a LaTeX background. LaTeX.css is not its own math
          display engine; rather, it uses MathJax to render mathematics formula, giving it a full set of accessibility
          features.</p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="topic_2c">
      <header>Conversion Tools</header>
      <article>
        <p>The web display engines above are only meant to read and render mathematics markup. The content itself must
          already be contained in an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document, and the display engines must be set up with the
          appropriate Javascript <span class="inline-code">script</span> parameters. In addition, the <abbr>HTML</abbr>
          document will likely require some responsive <abbr>CSS</abbr> to accommodate the multitude of devices
          accessing web content today.</p>
        <p>Even beyond this, many authors and organizations may need to convert entire documents. An article written in
          LaTeX, for example, may contain:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Inline mathematics</li>
          <li>Block display mathematics</li>
          <li>Abstract</li>
          <li>Table of Contents</li>
          <li>Document Sections</li>
          <li>Tables</li>
          <li>Special formatting for content blocks such as theorems, lemmas, and definitions.</li>
          <li>Numbered or bulleted lists</li>
          <li>Images</li>
          <li>Figures</li>
          <li>Code Blocks</li>
          <li>Footnotes</li>
          <li>Automatic numbering for any of the above</li>
          <li>Bibliography</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As many of these elements are also native to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, a direct conversion is theoretically
          <em>possible</em>, but quite difficult in practice.</p>
        <p>There are several document conversion tools to assist with this part of the process. Each has their own
          strengths, and each conversion will require some additional testing for responsiveness across devices and
          accessibility support. The tools discussed here are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Markdown</li>
          <li>Pandoc</li>
          <li>TeX4ht</li>
          <li>Latexml</li>
          <li>Latex.js</li>
          <li>Latex2html</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Markdown</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> is not so much a
          conversion <em>tool</em> as it is a markup language itself that is meant to <em>be converted</em> into
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Markdown is a bridge between plain text and <abbr>HTML</abbr>, designed for fast authoring
          but still readable as plain text. Markdown uses syntax such as <span class="inline-code">*emphasis
            text*</span> to represent <em>emphasis text</em> and <span class="inline-code">**strong**</span> to
          represent <strong>strong text</strong>. It is an ideal option for authors that want to minimize the amount of
          additional coding needed to render their work.</p>
        <p>Markdown can be written in any text editor, but requires a Markdown reader to render its output. Many
          browsers, <abbr>HTML</abbr> authoring tools, collaborative workspaces, and online forums can automatically
          read and render Markdown.</p>
        <p>LaTeX markup can be included in a Markdown document by enclosing the LaTeX code between math mode delimiters,
          just as in an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document. Then, the entire Markdown document can be converted to
          <abbr>HTML</abbr> by a popular tool called Pandoc. This process is described below.</p>

        <h1>Pandoc</h1>
        <p><a href="https://pandoc.org/index.html" target="_blank">Pandoc</a> is an extremely powerful "universal
          document converter" capable of parsing and converting between hundreds of file formats. It is run from a
          command line interface (<abbr>CLI</abbr>) by specifying the to- and from- formats along with any special
          options available to those formats.</p>
        <p>As mentioned above, for a Markdown document that contains mathematics markup, Pandoc can call MathJax (or
          another engine) to render the mathematics as it converts the Markdown syntax to <abbr>HTML</abbr>. The
          resulting <abbr>HTML</abbr> file will have MathJax automatically set up in the <span
            class="inline-code">script</span> section, and can work as a template for future use.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to read more about the many capabilities of Pandoc at the <a
            href="https://pandoc.org/index.html" target="_blank">Pandoc home page</a>.</p>

        <h1>TeX4ht</h1>
        <p><a href="https://tug.org/tex4ht/" target="_blank">TeX4ht</a> was developed in 2004 to convert directly from
          TeX source files to <abbr>HTML</abbr> and several other formats. It is now included as part of the TeXLive and
          MikTeX distributions. It incorporates MathJax (and other methods) for mathematics output, includes the ability
          to add some custom <abbr>CSS</abbr> to the final <abbr>HTML</abbr> output, can convert documents written with
          R Markdown (discussed under the Ebooks section) and Overleaf, and has other unique features.</p>
        <h1>LaTeXML</h1>
        <p><a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a> was developed to convert LaTeX markup to an
          internal <abbr>XML</abbr> format specifically for the <a href="https://dlmf.nist.gov/" target="_blank">Digital
            Library of Mathematical Functions</a> (<abbr>DLMF</abbr>) project at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/"
            target="_blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (<abbr>NIST</abbr>). In turn, the
          internal <abbr>XML</abbr> could be used to export to <abbr>HTML</abbr>, with various customizable settings. It
          also uses MathJax to render mathematics. The LaTeXML site has a sample web editor that converts user input to
          rendered <abbr>HTML</abbr>, and offers numerous built-in examples.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX.js</h1>
        <p><a href="https://latex.js.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX.js</a> is an interesting engine that ports full LaTeX
          documents into <abbr>HTML</abbr> while also reproducing their original LaTeX style formatting, similar to
          LaTeX.css. The web site showcases a side by side comparison of a sample LaTeX document to the rendered
          <abbr>HTML</abbr>. The engine is extensible and the project aims to automate translation of more native LaTeX
          environments. LaTeX.js uses the KaTeX engine to render mathematical formulas, and thus does not have
          accessibility support at this time.</p>
        <h1>LaTeX2HTML</h1>
        <p><a href="https://www.latex2html.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX2HTML</a> was ahead of the curve, dating back to
          1999. It is a command line tool that converts a LaTeX document into several <abbr>HTML</abbr> files to provide
          a paginated navigation similar to the original LaTeX PDF output. It automatically generates necessary
          hyperlinks, recreates lists, and converts mathematics, tables, and figures as into images. While the process
          does not provide alt-text, an author can insert alt-text for all necessary components.</p>

        <p>What is tagged pdf?</p>
        Tagged PDF is a semantically enriched PDF file that provides navigation structure for assistive technology.
        If this sounds similar to the idea behind HTML, that's because it is.
        Remarkably similar to HTML discussion.
        PDF internationally standardized 2008.
        PDF was meant to be a universally accessible document, and has had tagging ability since 2001 (?).
        PDF/UA standard as accessible format (year?)
        Authoring tools are limited to office & publishing.
        There is a formula tag in the PDF/UA specifications, but to this day, no authoring tools exist for math!

      <article>
        <p>There are four standards for authoring and reading mathematics in Braille:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Nemeth Braille</li>
          <li>UEB</li>
          <li>GS8</li>
          <li>DotsPlus</li>
        </ol>
        <p>From a computer, Braille can be read by a user with a <a href="">Refreshable Braille Display</a>,
          and printed out onto perforated paper using special <a href="">Braille Printers</a>.</p>
        <p>MathJax support?</p>

        <h1>Nemeth Braille</h1>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/mathscience/nemeth1972.pdf" target="_blank">Nemeth Braille Code</a> 
          was created in 1946 by Dr. Abraham Nemeth to represent
          mathematical expressions and scientific content that was not possible with the
          English Braille American Edition (<abbr>EBAE</abbr>) literary Braille system alone.
          Nemeth Braille uses a 6-dot Braille cell, the same as literary Braille, with a mix
          of its own unique symbols and standard EBAE. To avoid confusion, Nemeth expressions are 
          embedded in literary Braille between special opening and closing symbols 
          (called <em>Nemeth Indicators</em>) that inform the reader when a mathematical or 
          scientific expression begins and ends.</p>.
        <p>Nemeth Braille was officially adopted by the Braille Authority of North America 
          (<abbr>BANA</abbr>) in 1952, last revised in 1972, and has been consistenly updated to
          represent modern mathematics, chemical equations, and other scientific disciplines.</p>
        <p>More recently, <a href="http://www.dotlessbraille.org/nubs.htm" target="_blank">the Nemeth Uniform Braille
            System</a> (<abbr>NUBS</abbr>) was proposed to better unify Nemeth Braille with literary Braille.</p>
        <p>Nemeth transcription for readers: </p>
        <h1><abbr>UEB</abbr></h1>
        <p><a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/ueb.html" target="_blank">Unified English Braille</a> (<abbr>UEB</abbr>) 
          is an overhaul of English Braille American Edition literary system to modernize and unify literary, 
          mathematical, and scientific content under one standard, and improve translation 
          between printed text and Braille.  UEB was officially adopted by <abbr>BANA</abbr> in 2012.
          UEB uses a different convention for mathematics than Nemeth Braille.  Since the prevalence and
          success of Nemeth Braille, UEB was updated in 2015 to allow readers to more easily work with their 
          preferred convention.</p>

        <h1>DotsPlus</h1>
        <p><a href="" target="_blank">DotsPlus</a> is a two-dimensional Braille system designed much
          more as a tactile font that mimics a written symbol. It was designed as a means for educators
          to present mathematics or other scientific content to blind users without having to learn Braille.
          It can be authored with MathType or other MathML generators and then output using the DotsPlus
          font from a computer. </p>
